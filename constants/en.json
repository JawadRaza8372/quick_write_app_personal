We don’t access, share, or sell your content to third parties.\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) Protection: QuickWriteAI does not retain PII in Written Content. Any PII detected in Written Content is automatically deleted to safeguard your privacy.\nData Security: QuickWriteAI follows strict security measures to ensure that sensitive information is not stored or misused.\n\nWe believe your QuickWriteAI experience should never compromise your privacy. Some ideas and communications are meant to remain private, and our commitment is to ensure your control over your Written Content. This policy also applies to the QuickWriteAI app and website."

				"title": "Data Retention and Deletion",
				"description": "User Control: QuickWriteAI includes a feature that allows users to permanently delete their Written Content at the end of a session. When a user clicks the 'End Session – Delete Data' button, all associated content from that session is permanently and irreversibly deleted. QuickWriteAI does not retain session-based Written Content after this deletion action is completed. This ensures user privacy and reinforces our commitment to secure and ephemeral writing experiences.\nNo Third-Party Sharing: QuickWriteAI does not share Written Content with third parties under any circumstances, except as required by law for security, compliance, or fraud prevention.\nData Retention: QuickWriteAI retains technical and interaction data related to the use of its Services for up to 30 days (the “retention period”). This retention period is solely for purposes such as maintaining service integrity, detecting abuse, and complying with legal obligations. After this period, the retained data is securely deleted from our systems. This process applies to all content not otherwise permanently deleted by the user through available in-app deletion features."

The 'End Session – Delete Data' function gives users full control to remove their data after each session, and any remaining technical or interaction data is automatically deleted after the retention period."

				"title": "QuickWriteAI applies the following deletion layers and deletion audit:",
				"description": "User Input (Secure Entry)\nThe user enters Written Content, which is immediately tagged for automatic deletion after the session.\nProcessing via Backend Proxy\nRequests are securely processed through QuickWriteAI’s backend (no client-side key exposure). This proxy architecture prevents API key leakage, hides user identities from the provider, and adds a privacy layer that decouples you from your requests. It’s equivalent to a privacy firewall.\nEphemeral Cache (Short-TTL Memory)\nTemporary storage for processing responses; automatically cleared. Do not store user Written Content; if buffering is required for retries, it is kept only in short-TTL memory/cache and purged when the user selects 'End Session – Delete Data.' This is designed to ensure your Written Content does not become a permanent record. Ephemeral session tokens ensure each session has a temporary ID that automatically expires, instantly clearing any remaining cached data when the session ends.\nEnd Session – Delete Data\nThis is where the user triggers full deletion. All cached Written Content and temporary session data are purged immediately.\nDeletion Audit (Audit Layer)\nEach delete session is verified by auditing the deletion logs and can be deleted, if any data wasn’t purged.\n30-Day Retention & Deletion\nOnly anonymized metadata (no Written Content) remains for 30 days, then auto-deleted."
